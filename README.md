# MyOnPipeClone
In this project, I tried to make OnPipe, my very first game. I developed this game in 2 days.

I have learned how to:

- Create endless game
- Create Object Pooler and how to use it.
- Handle the game and how to handle finish conditions.
- Handle point system.
- Create camera script that follows target.
- Use Blender for my games when needed.
- Use animations in Unity.
